        <h6 className='eight columns offset-by-two quotation'>"Brad is an intelligent, motivated individual with a thirst for knowledge. His analytical skills allow him to look at a problem logically and get down to the root cause efficiently. He doesn't settle for just knowing "what" - he wants to know the how and why, which during his time working for me allowed him to obtain a far above average understanding of the systems we supported. He never hesitates to help colleagues and is genuinely interested in contributing to the team and larger organization. I would not hesitate to bring him back on to my team and would highly recommend him for any software project."</h6>
